\section{Datasets}

Our RL agent is generating CNN architectures which are performing an image classification task on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

CIFAR datasets are described in very deep details in Chapter 3 of \cite{CIFAR}, especially details about it's collection.

I would not go into details, just will note that CIFAR is a set of $32\times 32$ colour images depicting real-world objects.

After training RL algorithm on CIFAR10 it is heavily switched to use it's knowledge on CIFAR100.

Key differences between CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 is denoted in table \ref{table:1}.

\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} 
 \hline
 Dataset & Size & Number of classes & Images in class \\ [0.5ex] 
 \hline
 CIFAR10 & 60000 & 10 & 6000 \\
 \hline
 CIFAR100 & 60000 & 100 grouped into 20 superclasses & 600 \\
 \hline \\ [0.5ex]
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets}

\end{table}

Both in CIFAR10 classes are exclusive and do not assume instances overlapping - see \ref{fig:cifar10}.
