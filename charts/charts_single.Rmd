```{r}
data <- read.csv(file="logs.csv")
data_ucb <- read.csv(file="logs_ucb.csv")
```

```{r}
gaussian <- data[data['controller'] == "gaussian",]
classic <- data[data['controller'] == "classic",]
gaussian_ucb <- data_ucb[data_ucb['controller'] == "gaussian",]
classic_ucb <- data_ucb[data_ucb['controller'] == "classic",]
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
